# Git Logger for terminal

This version of git logger is made using typescript.  

## Dependencies
* RobotJS [yarn add robotjs](http://robotjs.io/)

## How it's going to work
It expects you already executed the 'git push' command ( oh my zsh alias ).  
It then types the username passed in the database, and then types the password ( encrypted in the database ).
